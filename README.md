# schedule-Generator
Challenge #5 on creating schedule generator that allows me to show the past, present, and future by different color codes shown on the time.

## Description 
In this Challenge I will be creating a schedule generator showing the date and time of todays date. By doing so I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my challenge. The color codes on the set time will show the user what is in the past, present, and furture by the change of colors on the schedule.



## improvements
working on this challenge has showed me what I still need to work on. I have made it to where the local storage is storing the key but doesn't have a specified value i'm assuming. I got the time zone to work but dont know how to make it to where if the hour has passed it changes colors. to further continue my improvements; local storage is not an easy topic when implementing the code to get the information inside the local storage to be placed inside my html and also save when i refresh the page. Coming to an understandment that I have to put in more hours in this topic becuase i wasn't able to do what was required.
